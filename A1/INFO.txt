We attempted the bonus case for handling cases when a START_MONITORING request
is made with pid = 0,
We implemented a 'blacklist case' which treats pids added to the pid list
as pids not being monitored
The 'blacklist case' returns to normal once a STOP_MONITORING request is made with
pid = 0 (ie. telling it to stop monitoring all pids), this reverts to the 
pid list being used to keep track of pids being monitored.
